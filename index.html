                    <p>I recently made the most amazing discovery!</p>
                    <p>It's going to turn the world of fish harvesting and care on its head. I just returned from a trip to the Caribbean where I took a day trip inland to see the ruins of the city of Tikal. As I was deep inside one of the ruins, I wandered down this hallway. At the end was this enormous engraving of a fish. Only it wasn't just a fish. It was a logoglyph surrounded by other ones. Somehow, I just could understanding the writing, even though I'd never seen it before. It described the Holy Fish Jutz'kar and his followers. The most holy of his followers were always a multiple of 3 inches in length. They cared for Jutz'kar and fed him. The next holy were his soldier fish - swordfish - and they were all multiples of 5 inches in length. Some were even as large as 250 inches!!</p>
                    <p>Based on this INCREDIBLE finding, I've decided to pay homage to the Great Fish Jutz'kar and his servants. As such, each fish in my collection has been designated with a badge based on their size and appropriate rank.</p>
